# About The Project
Distance from an object is measured by Ultrasonic Sensor Module HC-SR04 <a href="https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Proximity/HCSR04.pdf">View Datasheet</a>, which is displayed in centimeters by I2C 1602 LCD Display. The distance is also visualized by LEDs which light up depending on the distance.
